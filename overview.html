 <h2 style="color:#002d72;"> Statistics for NYC Public Middle Schools </h2>
To give you an introduction to the public middle schools in New York, we have gathered some key statistics that will be presented below.
    In general, information about the five boroughs of New York, <i>Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn,  Queens </i> and <i> Staten Island </i> is given.
    The first plot shows the total number of schools in each school district and which borough each school district belongs so that you 
    can track your favorite school district throughout the rest of the plots.
  For better overview, the color used for each borough is consistent throughout the plots. 
  If you use mouse hover on the plots the exact numbers will be presented.

  In the top plot on the left hand side you can see how many public middle schools there are in each of the 32 school districts. 
    Furthermore, the colors indicate which borough each of the districts belong to. The plot below shows you the total number of schools
    in each borough. In the top plot on the right hand side you can see the total number of students enrolled in a public
    middle school in each of the boroughs. The plot below shows the average class size in each borough calculated as the student-teacher ratio.

<div class = "textbox" > 
    Staten Island only has one school district, hence there are significantly fewer schools and total number of enrolled students in this borough.
    The average class sizes are very similar across the boroughs with the smallest being Bronx's average on 12.5 and the largest being Queens's average with 14.7.

    The top plot on the left hand side shows the average female/male distribution in the schools for each borough. 
    On the right hand side the overall development of the female/male distribution from 2006-2018 is shown. 
    The middle plots show the percentage of each etnicity in the schools in each borough and the overall development in the percentage of etnicities, respectively. 
    These percentages are based on the number of students from each etnicity that is enrolled in the middle schools and is therefore not necessarily an indication 
	   of the general trend in each borough. In fact, etnicities with a low representation in these plots might be an indication of these groups being more
	  willing to choose private schools. 
    The bottom plot on the left hand side shows the rental prices for housing in each borough. The rental prices are divided into three 
	   categories; <i> <20$ per sqft, 20-30$ per sqft</i> and <i> >30$ per sqft </i>. Based on the average rental price in individual postal code areas, 
	   the schools have been placed in one of these categories. The plot shows how many percent of the schools in a borough that
	   fall within each category. 
   The plot on the bottom right hand side shows the crimes per 100.000 New York citizen that are commited within each borough. Again, this has been divided 
	   into three categories; <i> < 30 felonies per 100.000, 30-60 felonies per 100.000 </i> and <i> >60 felonies per 
	   100.000 </i>. Then, the schools are categorized based on their locations and how many felonies that happened in the area that location fall under.
	  The plot shows how many percent of the schools in a borough that fall within each category.

  <div class = "textbox" > 
   The middle plots show that there is a high percentage of hispanic students enrolled in the public middle schools in all boroughs. This
	  could indicate that people with this etnicity in general do not send their children to private schools. It is also shown 
	  that Bronx is the borough with the highest percentage of black students in public middle schools, while Staten Island has
	  the highest percentage of white public middle school students. 
   The two bottom plots indicate that there is a negative correlation between rental prices and crime rates. Bronx is the borough with the
	  lowest rental prices but is also the borough with the highest number of crimes. In comparison, Manhattan has a high percentage of
	   schools located in areas with a high rental price and is also the borough with most schools located in areas with less than 30 
	   felonies per 100.000.

   The plot on the top left hand side shows the latest average english language arts (ELA) and math score in each borough, while the plot next to it shows
   the trend line for the average ELA and math score based on the results for all boroughs combined.
   The bottom plots show the absence rates. These are calculated as the average percentage of students that were absent on a given school day. 
   On the left, this is shown for each borough while the plot to the right shows the trend line from 2006-2018 for all boroughs combined.

   The plot on the top right shows that the average scores in the boroughs are quite close to each other. 
	  Bronx both has the lowest average math score and ELA score with 191 and 205, respectively. Bronx is also the borough that 
	  on average has the highest absence rate, while Queen is the borough with the lowest absence rate. In general, it appears that
	  the performance on the ELA test is consistently a bit higher than on the math test.

	 <h2 style="color:#002d72;"> Summary </h2> 
  </center> 
</div>
</center>	  
<center>		   
  <div class = "textbox" > 
	  To sum up, based on this data <b>Bronx</b> is 
	  the borough with the lowest rent prices, highest crime rates and lowest test scores, which indicates that this is an area with 
	  more socioeconimically disadvantaged people. In general
	  more than 90% of the students in a public middle school in this borough are hispanic or black. <b>Manhattan</b> on the
	  other hand has the highest test scores and is also a borough with high rent prices and with most schools located 
	  in areas with the least felonies happening. This suggests that people at Manhattan come from a higher social class 
	  with parents that have more resources to help their children with homework. The public middle schools at Manhattan 
	  appear to have a quite high diversity index regarding etnicities. <b>Brooklyn</b> and <b>Queens</b> have
	  very similar patterns when it comes to test scores and rental prices. However, Queens has more areas with many felonies 
	  happening and a higher percentage of asian students, whereas Brooklyn has a higher percentage of black students. 
	  Finally, <b>Staten Island</b> has the highest percentage of white students in their middle schools but does not stand
	  out on neither crime rates, rental prices or test scores.
